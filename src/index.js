Add a UI to your application.

Return the date of a user's next birthday on each planet.

Return the age Keith Richards will be in dog years on the planet Jupiter in 2073.

Assuming that the average lifespan of a mayfly is 5 minutes, determine how many mayfly lifespans a human user has lived and then compare it the current age (in Earth years) of our sun.

Make your application look nice and give it a solar theme!
